# About "brunstubs"

I have some coding style that I like to do for my side projects. 

This is in a very early stage, and there's a lot of room for improvement, and a lot of architecture pattern I will include in this.

This repo, is a [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/) implementation, of cool stubs, that follows my architecture. And to facilitate usage among all my projects.

The packages that I usually use, and this stubs are following the styles are:

- [spatie/laravel-data](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-data/v4/introduction)
- [lorisleiva/laravel-actions](https://www.laravelactions.com/)
- [darkaonline/l5-swagger](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger)

Data classes and Actions for handling data and executing tasks.

The l5-swagger is to annotate my Laravel HTTP Resources, and use [Orval](https://orval.dev/) to generate TypeScript stuff. (as well as eventually a swagger spec of course).
And for routing provider in JS, I use [Laravel Wayfinder](laravel/wayfinder).

I don't have any pattern for contributing to this project yet!!, but feel free to fork and open PR's or suggest new stuff. I pretend to commit to this side project when possible.
